The Lifecycle of a ConfigMap Entry

Many beginners assume a "link" exists between 
their local files and the cluster. There isn't one. 
Here is the actual data flow.

Local File -> YAML Snapshot

When you run 
`kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=nginx.conf`, 
Kubernetes performs a one-time copy.

It effectively does this:
1. Opens `nginx.conf` on your laptop.
2. Reads the entire content as a string.
3. Pastes that string into the `data` section of a YAML object.

**The Result:**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  # Key = Original Filename
  # Value = "Big ass value" (Content of the file)
  nginx.conf: |
    server {
      listen 80;
      ...
    }
