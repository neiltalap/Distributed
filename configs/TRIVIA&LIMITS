Final Edge Cases & Trivia


1. The "Ghost" Volume (Default Token)
If you run `kubectl describe pod`, you will often 
see a volume you never defined: `default-token-xxxxx`.

* **What is it?** Kubernetes automatically creates 
a Secret containing credentials (token, ca.crt) for the API server.

* **Where is it?** Mounted at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount`.
* **Can I stop it?** Yes. If your pod does not need to talk to the K8s API, 
you can disable it in the Pod spec:
    
```yaml
    spec:
      automountServiceAccountToken: false
```


2. The Size Limit
Secrets and ConfigMaps are **not** for big data.

* Limit: **1MB**.
* Reason: These objects are stored in etcd (the K8s brain), which is designed for small, fast updates, not file storage. If you try to create a ConfigMap larger than 1MB, the API server will reject it.


3. The "Lazy" Way to Image Pull Secrets
We discussed adding `imagePullSecrets` to every single 
Pod YAML to use a private registry. That gets annoying.

You can add the secret to your **ServiceAccount** instead.
1.  Link the secret to the `default` ServiceAccount.
2.  Any Pod creating using that account (which is all of them by default) 
automatically gets the image pull credentials. You never have to 
write `imagePullSecrets` in your Pod YAML again.
