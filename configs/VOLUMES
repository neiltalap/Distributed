Deep Dive: ConfigMap and Secret Volumes

When you use a ConfigMap or Secret as a volume, 
you are asking Kubernetes to "project" data from 
its internal database (etcd) into the filesystem 
of your container. 

This behaves differently than a standard disk mount.



1. The "Directory Overwrite" Behavior (The Trap)
When you mount a volume to a directory, 
**Kubernetes takes over that entire directory.**

**Scenario:**
* Your image has a folder `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` containing `default.conf`.
* You mount a ConfigMap volume to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`.

**Result:**
* `default.conf` vanishes (it is hidden).
* The directory now ONLY contains the files from your ConfigMap.

**The Fix (`subPath`):**
If you want to place *one* file into a directory 
without wiping out its neighbors, you use `subPath`.

```yaml
volumeMounts:
- name: config
  mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d/my-custom.conf  # Path to the specific file
  subPath: my-custom.conf                       # Key in the ConfigMap
